# Site Reliability Learning

## Why become an SRE (short)

I aim to transition into a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) role to take on more significant challenges beyond my current position as a sysadmin. Over the past years, I've successfully integrated Docker and Azure, automating tasks and enhancing efficiency. I've also ventured into K8s, Docker swarm, and ELK stack. Additionally, I've leveraged Azure services like Office 365, Power Automate, and Graph API to automate workflows and improve productivity.

I've witnessed the impact of automation in IT and understand the limitations that many administrators face in this regard. My ultimate goal is to become a principal administrator in the SRE field, overseeing a larger network of systems. SREs form the core of a company's IT foundation, and I'm driven to help businesses thrive by adopting modern tools and practices.

## Why become an SRE (long)

I want to become an SRE because it represents the next challenge beyond my current role as a sysadmin. Over the past few years, I've successfully integrated Docker and Azure technologies into our operations, automating previously manual processes and reducing the time spent on mundane tasks. While incorporating DevOps concepts has improved our production projects, I've reached the limits of my current role and aspire to take on more significant challenges in areas like production K8s, Docker Swarm, ELK stack, and more. SRE work offers extensive opportunities to learn about automation and optimization.

I set up a Docker Compose file to consistently deploy our internal IT tools such as Zammad, Zabbix, and Snipe IT, and it has proven to be resilient. Building on this experience, I transformed the Compose file into a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster, which can be further configured using Terraform on the host server.

In Azure, we established various Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, including Office 365, Microsoft Power Automate, and Microsoft Graph API, to automate and enhance our company's workflow. Attachments can now be automatically downloaded to specific folders, SharePoint folders can be managed via emails, and we can extract desired queries through the Graph API related to user passwords and relevant computer information within our hybrid Azure environment.

However, since we are only a team of three, learning the CI/CD workflow between the developers and operations engineers is a challenge as I am the only admin committing to this workflow. I want to work in an environment where I can learn from others and come out knowing more about the DevOps workflow and that is why I want to leave my current position.

Many companies grapple with automation, a task that typically falls outside the average IT administrator's scope. Ultimately, I aspire to become a principal administrator in this field, overseeing and managing a larger network of systems. I firmly believe that SREs are the cornerstone of a company's IT core. Without a solid foundation, businesses face the risk of internal failures that are entirely preventable. My goal is to assist companies in thriving by adapting to the available tools and best practices.

## Infrastructure - Learning Terraform for Docker and Azure

Because I am most familiar with Docker and Azure, I want to start here in Terraform so that I can structure my environment at work and home in a way that I understand.
